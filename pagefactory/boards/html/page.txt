<h1>Boards</h1>
<p>
The boards are for converting the control signals made by the Arduino circuit board into a signal with enough power to drive a motor, and into a signal which can have its direction reversed.  They are called "dual H bridge" boards because they have two circuits, each of which is shaped like a capitol English letter "H", which serve to direct the current.  Each "H" has four transistors, which each act as a switch.

    Buy these: 
    <a href = "https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/The_H_bridge_that_looks_like_an__H_.html">https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/The_H_bridge_that_looks_like_an__H_.html

    </a>
    Or find someone who is willing to buy a ton of them and share.  Shipping costs way more than the boards so the more people who can go in together on that the cheaper they are per board.

    Buy transistors, the IRF7862.  Check prices on octopart, buy from cheapest or just go to digikey for easy but less cheap.  50 cents from Arrow here:
